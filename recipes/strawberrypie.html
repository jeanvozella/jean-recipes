<h1 class="title">Strawberry Pie</h1>
<img src="../img/strawpie.png">
<p>This strawberry pie is my favorite pie, and it's very easy to make. I got the recipe many years ago in North Jersey from the Sussex County Strawberry Farm.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
    <li>1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
    <li>¾ cup water</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Arrange 1/2 of strawberries in baked pastry shell. Place remaining strawberries in a medium saucepan.</li>
<br>
<li>Add sugar to the strawberries in the saucepan; place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.</li>
<br>
<li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Gradually stir cornstarch mixture into boiling strawberry mixture. Reduce heat and simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
<br>
<li>Pour cooked strawberry mixture over berries in pastry shell. Refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 3 hours.</li>
<br>
<li>Before serving, whip cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Serve each slice of pie with a dollop of whipped cream.</li>
